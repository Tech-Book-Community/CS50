## Pixels

* Pixels
A pixel is the smallest addressable element in a dot matrix to describe amount of color of R, G, B. It's also used for describing resolution in display device.

### RGB expressions
<img src ="https://hackmd.io/_uploads/ry_7vmR-C.png" width = 35% style="display: block; margin: auto"> 
* A pixel color can be represented by amount of Red, Green, Blue.
* In  this convention, 255 is the largest value, and the 0 is the smallest. (0 means color is black. 
* There're another discription for color in hexadecimal : [#6699FF](#1/1). This numeral system is called Hexadecimal numeral system.

### Hexadecimal numeral system 
* Hexadecimal
In base-10 numeral system counting from 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9,..., and every ten counts adds to 1 carry.
In hexadecimal system, counting starts from : 
0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E, F, ..., and every 16th counts adds to 1 carry.

* Why use it?
    In computer science, it's very often to use stream of bits (or pattern) to record data. since these long patterns are very hard for human to handle.
    
    The length of bits pattern in computer are usually 4's multiple, one hexadecimal character can represent a 4 bits pattern. For simplification,  we take advantage of hexadecimal notation (or other numeral system) to solve this problem. 

* Hexadecimal and Bits pattern: 0~7 (base- 10)
    
| Bits pattern | Hexadecimal |
|:------------:|:-----------:|
|     0000     |      0      |
|     0001     |      1      |
|     0010     |      2      |
|     0011     |      3      |
|     0100     |      4      |
|     0101     |      5      |
|     0110     |      6      |
|     0111     |      7      |

* Hexadecimal and Bits pattern: 8~15 (base- 10)

| Bits pattern | Hexadecimal |
|:------------:|:-----------:|
|     1000     |      8      |
|     1001     |      9      |
|     1010     |      A      |
|     1011     |      B      |
|     1100     |      C      |
|     1101     |      D      |
|     1110     |      E      |
|     1111     |      F      |

## Memory allocation 

## Static and Dynamic Memory Allocation
1. Static Memory Allocation: 
1-1. The allocation of memory performs at the compile time.
1-2. Static memory allots memory from the stack.
2. Dynamic Memory Allocation: 
2-1. The allocation of memory performs at execution or run time.
2-2. Dynamic memory allots from the heap.

### Pointer & Arrays
        
"a" is an array containing five integers. While "pa" is a pointer pointing to array "a".

<div style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.9); color: #1A237E; padding: 10px 5px 5px 10px;">
<img src = "https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SyKIKR4xC.png" alt = "drawing" width = 45% style = "display:block; margin: auto">
</div>    

```C 
// pa is a pointer pointing to an integer
int *pa;

// pa points to the first element of a
// It's also equivalent to pa = a;
pa = &a[0];

// points to the next element in a: a[1]
pa + 1

// get the value at location a[1]
*(pa +1)
```

* Practice

```c 
int x = 1, y = 2, z[10];
int *ip; // ip is a pointer to int
ip = &x; // ip now points to x's address
y = *ip; // go to ip's address and get the value, y is now 1
*ip = 0; // x is now 0
ip = &z[0]; // ip now points to z[0]
```

* One way to dynamically allocate memory is to use malloc(). 
    * datatype *variableName = malloc(sizeof(datatype)  of units)
* int *var = malloc ( sizeof( int) * 3)   
* Allots 4 * 3 = 12 bytes memory to a variable named var.
* Remember, once you run to the end of your code, before exiting the program, use free() to free memory allocated, otherwise, it'll cause memory leakage/loss. 

### System stack memory

![image](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/ry23Lamx0.png)

* A main function includes local variables, pointer, and return address.
<img src = "https://hackmd.io/_uploads/H1UglAmgR.png" alt = "drawing" width= 40% style="display: block; margin: 50px 100px 50px 150px;">

* When the program executes to the line and calling the function f1, the system stack's top frame becomes f1.
</br>
<img src = "https://hackmd.io/_uploads/Sy3xeC7g0.png" alt = "drawing" width= 40% style="display: block; margin: 50px 100px 50px 150px;">
</br>

f1 is composed of a local variable, pointer, and return address. The pointer points to the function block called f1. The return address in f1 records the address where the line in the main should f1 return values.
</br>
<img src = "https://hackmd.io/_uploads/r1Q-l07gR.png" alt = "drawing" width= 80% style="display: block; margin: 50px 100px 50px 150px;">

## File I/O
Demonstrate reading and writing into a file use one of the problem in week 4 : recover. 
First, create a buffer to read or write to the file per unit at a time, and set a condition to stop reading or writing if read to the end of the file.


```c [1-8]
// Allocate a file memory to create an output file
//and in read or write mode
FILE *output = fopen(filename/path, "r/w")

// Create a buffer to read input files one unit at a time
// A buffer: "header",  has a datatype of uint8_t 
// (8 bits unsigned integer)
uint8_t header[HEADER_SIZE];
```

```c 
// Read from input file:
// read from the buffer: "header", which  unit size is HEADER_SIZE. Read 1 unit of data.
fread(header, HEADER_SIZE, 1, input)

// Write to output file:
// Write 1 unit size of "HEADER_SIZE" to output
fwrite(header, HEADER_SIZE, 1, output)

// Close files after executing
fclose(input)
fclose(output)
```

## Memory leaks check: [Valgrind](https://valgrind.org/docs/manual/mc-manual.html#mc-manual.options)
Sometimes the terminal window won't show a memory error when you compile the program. Using the valgrind command to check memory leaks is very important.  

<p>Here's an example using valgrind from week 4 p-set: recover.</p>

![image](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SkA3hAEg0.png)

<p>1. In HEAP SUMMARY</p> 

* <p>" 472 bytes in 1 block are still reachable in loss record 1 of 1."</p> 
  <p>It means 1 block of memory wasn't freed before the program exits. The cause happened at line 64 using fopen().</p>       

<p>2. In LEAK SUMMARY</p>

* <p>definitely lost</p>
    This means no pointer to the block can be found. The block is classified as "lost".

* <p>inderectly lost</p>
    This means the block is lost not because there are no pointer points to it, but rather because all the block points to it themselves are lost. (You may think of a binary tree, whose root node is lost, although its children still have some pointers pointing to them(the root), children's nodes are still indirectly lost.)

* <p>possibly lost</p>
    This means that a chain of one or more pointers to the block has been found, but at least one of the pointers is an interior pointer. To correctly free memory, it's safer to use a pointer points to the "start" of the block of memory.
    (interior pointer: a pointer points to somewhere in the middle of a block of memory.)

* <p>suppressed</p>
    The suppressed message means that Valgrind hid some messages not to show you, which are either positive/negative issues within the system library.

### Overflow
1. A ***heap overflow*** is when you touch areas of memory you are ***not*** supposed to (where may already allocated to another variable,..., etc.).
2. A ***stack overflow*** happens when you call too many functions and your computer doesn't have enough memory.
3. Both 1 and 2 are considered buffer overflow which means the buffer exceeds its storage capacity.


## Psets
### [Filter-less](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2024/psets/4/filter/less/)
Before solving problems, understand the usage of each file in the folder. 
1. An image folder called images containing  .bmp files which is also the input image files.  

2. filter.c: The main file to transform input .bmp to filtered .bmp image.

3. helpers.c: You'll need to complete the four filters' functions, including grayscale, sepia, reflect and blur filter.

4. A Makefile: This file tells the compiler how to compile the filter. c, using files in the folder.

5. <bmp.h>: It's a self-defined header file to define BMP-related data types. Picture below defines a struct datatype: RGBTRIPLE, storing R, G, and B values in a single pixel.

<img src = "https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HJd1tqQxC.png" alt = "drawing" width= 40% style="display: block; margin: auto">  

*  When you zoom in on a picture closely, you may find an image is represented with a grid of pixels. A BMP image is a map formed by bits. It supports 1-, 4-, 8-, 16-, 24-, and 32-bit color. In this practice problem, we use a 24-bit color format.

<div style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.9); color: #1A237E; margin: 50px 120px;">
    
![rgbpixel](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/S1_PhDmeA.png)
    
</div>
* A color image is filled with Red, Green, and Blue and uses 8 bits to represent each color.

![courtyard](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/B19IDwXxC.png)

The Original picture
</br></br>
#### Grayscale
A black-and-white image means there must not be too much Red or Green and too much blue color. These colors have to be equivalent amounts in a pixel. In this sense, we can get the grayscale value by calculating the average value of R, G, and B and setting the value to the new R, G, and B values.
        
```c
// demo:
BYTE x = round((image[i][j].rgbBlue + image[i][j].rgbGreen + 
image[i][j].rgbRed)/3.0);

RGBTRIPLE newrgbBlue = x;
RGBTRIPLE newrgbGreen = x;
RGBTRIPLE newrgbRed = x;
```

<img src = "https://hackmd.io/_uploads/H1sNeOXl0.png" alt = "grayscaleimg" width= 100% style="display: block; margin: auto">

Result of the grayscale image

#### Sepia
* Sepia filter has its formula to calculate each R, G, and B value:  
    1. ***sepiaRed*** = .393 * originalRed + .769 * originalGreen + .189 * originalBlue
    2. ***sepiaGreen*** = .349 * originalRed + .686 * originalGreen + .168 * originalBlue
    3. ***sepiaBlue*** = .272 * originalRed + .534 * originalGreen + .131 * originalBlue
    4. (newed, newGreen, newBlue) = (separated, sepiaGreen, sepiaBlue)

* R, G, and B use 8 bits to record color data (i.e. 256 color depth: from 0 to 255). If the result is beyond 255, you should set it to 255.

<img src = "https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SJkhXuXgC.png" alt = "grayscaleimg" width= 100% style="display: block; margin: auto">

Result of sepia filter image

####  Reflect
* In the reflecting filter, the image flips horizontally. Reversing one row of image pixels once at a time, and so on the other rows.        

* Image row [ i ]: 
<div style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.9); color: #1A237E; margin: 10px 120px;">
    
<img src = "https://hackmd.io/_uploads/S1X1j_7xC.png" alt = "drawing" width= 60% style="display: block; margin: auto">

</div>

Reversed horizontally image row [ i ]
<div style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.9); color: #1A237E; margin: 10px 120px;">
    
<img src = "https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SkoWid7xA.png" alt = "drawing" width= 60% style="display: block; margin: auto">   

</div>    

Swap pixels from index 0 to the middle index of the row. Recall that in the swap examples in the course video, passing by values and passing by copies.
![image](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rJuM2_mlA.png)
* *a is the pointer of the row image on the left side, while *b is the row image on the right side. Also declared a temporary pointer points to a's address. 
* Re-assign pointer points to the address of *b points at, and vice versa, re-assign *b points to address the tmp, which records pointer a.

<img src = "https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SJmjTO7xC.png" alt = "grayscaleimg" width= 100% style="display: block; margin: auto"></br>

Result of the reflected image   
    
#### Blur
There are many types of blur filters. A boxed blur filter is for this problem.
    Boxed-blur filter takes adjacent pixels' (along with itself) average as its new R, G, and B values.

<img src = "https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SJUYqtmlC.png" alt = "drawing" width= 70% style="display: block; margin: 50px 120px;">

* Demonstrate pixels in different positions of the image in one color, taking their average as follows:
1. In the middle of the image: The pixel "6"
( 1 + 2 + 3 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 9 + 10 + 11 ) / 9

2. At the edge of the image: The pixel "8"
( 3 + 4 + 7 + 8 + 11 + 12 ) / 6

3. At the corner of the image: The pixel "1" 
( 1 + 2 + 5 + 6 ) / 4 

* How to select pixels needed for computing blurred values? Use a 3x3 matrix called "mask" to obtain the pixels' location, and the centered element of the matrix mask is mask[ 1 ][ 1 ], which is the pixel under calculation.

* mask[  i  ][  j  ] records the adjacent pixels' R, G, and B values with the data type BYTE, and a pixel's datatype is RGBTRIPPLE. 
 
<div style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.9); color: #1A237E; margin: 10px 80px;">

<img src = "https://hackmd.io/_uploads/Bk1al9mg0.png" alt = "drawing" width= 50% style="display: block; margin: auto">

</div></br>

* mask[i][j] records the corresponding position of the image 

<div style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.9); color: #1A237E; margin: 10px 80px;">

<img src = "https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rkkEZcXlC.png" alt = "drawing" width= 50% style="display: block; margin: auto">

</div></br>

1. Copy the original image so we won't mess up subsequential data when moving on to the next blurred pixel's calculation.
2. Create mask[  i  ][  j  ] with i rows and j cols to record all the pixels' data needed for the calculation.
3. Define mask row and col size, considering edge and corner case.
4. Add up all the values in the mask and take the average to get the new R, G, and B.

### [Filter-more](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2024/psets/4/filter/more/)
In the Filter-more problem, image filter functions that need implementation are the Grayscale, Reflect,  Blur, and Edge. Three of them are already in the Filter-less problem, so we only discuss the edge filter in this problem.

* Edge detection filter 
1. [Sobel operator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sobel_operator)
* Edge filter 
The edge filter detects whether there are significant brightness or color differences in the contours of an image area. One way to achieve this effect is to apply the Sobel operator.

* Gx and Gy are Sobel operators that calculate the approximations of the derivatives for the image's x-direction and y-direction.
                   
<div style="text-align": center>   
    
|   |Gx |   |    |Gy  |    |                       
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:--:|:--:|:--:|       
|-1 |0  |1  | -1 | -2 | -1 |                      
|-2 |0  |2  |0   |0   |0   |                     
|-1 |0  |1  |1   |2   |1   |
    
</div>

* To obtain the edge-filtered image, first, find adjacent pixels (including itself) of an image pixel denoted as image[ i ][ j ] (Just like the matrix mask in blur filter problem) and conduct convolution with Gx and Gy separately. Second,  add the squared convolution result(Gx^2 + Gy^2), and finally, take the square root to get the edge filter's new R, G, and B values. 
* Caution that the "^" operator does not calculate the square value in C, representing the bitwise operator XOR. Directly times itself twice: Gx * Gx, or use pow(Gx, 2) instead. 
  
Here's my attempt: 
```c [1-17]
void edges(int height, int width, RGBTRIPLE image[height][width])
{
// input parameters are: image height, image width, and the whole image 
// carries Red,  Green, and Blue color information, stored in RGBTRIPLE data type in a pixel.

// Block 1: Copy the original image 
// to conduct convolution per pixel 
// and not influence other original pixels

RGBTRIPLE copy[height][width];
for (int p = 0; p < height; p++)
{
    for (int q = 0; q < width; q++)
    {
        copy[p][q] = image[p][q];
    }
}
```

```c [1-14]
// Block 2: Create a matrix containing pixels needed to perform the calculation
// to calculate new R, G, and B values: edge_Red, edge_Green, edge_Blue.
// (There's no necessity to use a pointer creating matrix, it's just personal practice in here.)

RGBTRIPLE(*mpt)[3][3] = malloc(sizeof(RGBTRIPLE) * 9);
(*mpt)[0][0] = copy[i - 1][j - 1];
(*mpt)[0][1] = copy[i - 1][j];
(*mpt)[0][2] = copy[i - 1][j + 1];
(*mpt)[1][0] = copy[i][j - 1];
(*mpt)[1][1] = copy[i][j];
(*mpt)[1][2] = copy[i][j + 1];
(*mpt)[2][0] = copy[i + 1][j - 1];
(*mpt)[2][1] = copy[i + 1][j];
(*mpt)[2][2] = copy[i + 1][j + 1];
```

```c []
// Block 3: Set constraints if the image pixel is at the corners or edge.
//Set values of pixels outside of the image to zero 
RGBTRIPLE *edge = malloc(sizeof(RGBTRIPLE));
edge->rgbtRed = 0;
edge->rgbtGreen = 0;
edge->rgbtBlue = 0;

if (i == 0){
    
    (*mpt)[0][0] = *edge;            
    (*mpt)[0][1] = *edge;
    (*mpt)[0][2] = *edge;
}

if (i == height - 1){
    
    (*mpt)[2][0] = *edge;
    (*mpt)[2][1] = *edge;
    (*mpt)[2][2] = *edge;
}

if (j == 0){
    
    (*mpt)[0][0] = *edge;
    (*mpt)[1][0] = *edge;
    (*mpt)[2][0] = *edge;
}

if (j == width - 1){
    
    (*mpt)[0][2] = *edge;
    (*mpt)[1][2] = *edge;
    (*mpt)[2][2] = *edge;
}

```

```c
// Block 4: Calculate the convolution of Gx and Gy
RGBTRIPLE *m00pt = &(*mpt)[0][0]; // *m00pt is the first element's address in the Matrix: mpt
int *Gxpt = &Gx[0][0];
int *Gypt = &Gy[0][0];
int sumx_edgeB = 0;
int sumy_edgeB = 0;
int sumx_edgeG = 0;
int sumy_edgeG = 0;
int sumx_edgeR = 0;
int sumy_edgeR = 0;

for (int n = 0; n < 9; n++) // conduct convolution and sum all adjacent pixels(including pixel under calculation itself)
{
    sumx_edgeB += ((m00pt + n)->rgbtBlue) * (*(Gxpt + n));
    sumy_edgeB += ((m00pt + n)->rgbtBlue) * (*(Gypt + n));
    sumx_edgeG += ((m00pt + n)->rgbtGreen) * (*(Gxpt + n));
    sumy_edgeG += ((m00pt + n)->rgbtGreen) * (*(Gypt + n));
    sumx_edgeR += ((m00pt + n)->rgbtRed) * (*(Gxpt + n));
    sumy_edgeR += ((m00pt + n)->rgbtRed) * (*(Gypt + n));
}
```

```c
// Block 5: Obtain the new R, G, and B values

double R = round(sqrt(pow(sumx_edgeR, 2) + pow(sumy_edgeR, 2)));
double G = round(sqrt(pow(sumx_edgeG, 2) + pow(sumy_edgeG, 2)));
double B = round(sqrt(pow(sumx_edgeB, 2) + pow(sumy_edgeB, 2)));

// * Remember to free memory before the program exits
free(*mpt);

```

## Additional knowledge
* Gray-scale formula:
The description of the Filter-less problem suggests taking an average of red, green, and blue values to complete the Greyscale filter function. There's another way to express the Grayscale formula. In NTSC^[1] is represented as:
0.299 * Red + 0.587 * Green + 0.114 * blue
